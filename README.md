Record and Simulate user actions on websites.

## But why?
There are times when we need to check/submit something on a website in a regular basis, and we don't want to hurt our hand everytime to do that. 
This is a project aimed to replace the repetitiveness of our hands with automation.

#### This is one of my hobby projects, made as a proof of concept so don't be suprised to see spaghetti code inside. 
#### I may improve and publish it in future if I see this being useful to everyone so if you're using it, give some feedback! 
Meanwhile, If you want, you can submit pull requests to improve this project.
